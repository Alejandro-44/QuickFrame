# Quick Frame
QuicFrame is a Kotlin DSL to create graphical user interfaces based on Java Swing. 
This DSL allows you:

- Define some elements of the user interface, such as buttons, text fields, checkboxes, etc. 
This can be done using an intuitive and easy to understand syntax.

- define different properties for each element.
For example, background color, font size and position on the screen.

- define events using buttons

This DSL avoids the use of `.` and `()`. Although in some occasions it will be necessary.

The main idea of this DSL is defined components similar to CSS, so you are going to define 
components properties line by line.
